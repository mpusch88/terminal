I'd take a look at ControlAppearance.idl, and ControlProperties.h.

	Move acrylic from CONTROL_SETTINGS to CONTROL_APPEARANCE_SETTINGS.

	Add a CONTROL_SETTINGS for EnableUnfocusedAcrylic

In MTSMSettings.h

	add a new global boolean X(bool, EnableUnfocusedAcrylic, "comaptibility.enableUnfocusedAcrylic", true)

	Similarly to above, move useAcrylic from MTSM_PROFILE_SETTINGS to MTSM_APPEARANCE_SETTINGS

Use the global setting when constructing a TerminalSettings in TerminalSettings::_ApplyAppearanceSettings

In TermControl.cpp, if EnableUnfocusedAcrylic is set, then switch the backdrop from acrylic.BackgroundSource(Media::AcrylicBackgroundSource::HostBackdrop); to Backdrop
